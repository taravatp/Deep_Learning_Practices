# Speech Recognition
This project is focused on converting audio files into text using a Seq2Seq model. the model consists of an encoder and a decoder. I experimented with different types of recurrent layers, such as LSTM, GRU, and simple RNN. 

## Accomplishments
- Implemented a Seq2Seq model for speech recognition.
- Experimented with different types of layers to improve accuracy.
- Preprocessed audio files to perpare them for the input of the encoder.
- preprocessed the persian texts to perpare them for the input of the decoder.
